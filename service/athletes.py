'''
This module is used to create or update an athlete's information in the database (SQLAlchemy at this time). Information to be tracked is Name, Current Division, and Current Classification.
(Later this will need to be refactored to include a seprate table so that the multiple sports, divisions and classes can be stored.) 

Actions to add.
- Add athlete - name, division, classification
- Update athlete - name, division, classification
- Remove athlete - name, division, classification
