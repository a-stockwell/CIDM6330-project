# CIDM6330-project
Project repository for CIDM6330 Spring 2022 Project.

Final shooters log project for CIDM 6330 Software Development class. West Texas A&M University Spring 2022.

Author: Robert Stockwell

## Abstract

This is to build a working site for following *Test Driven Development* (TDD) method of building software. Following the method ologies in the APP book. Using Flask as a processor and SQLAlchemy for persistance. 

## Structure

1. Domain-Training-Log.drawio - This is the domain model that was initially worked up for the project. Created using the Draw.io desktop software.
    * Working on modifying as we move along the process.
    * Updated using the APP reference in Chapter 6 Unit of Work figure 6-1. (Don't know if it right or not)
2. service (folder) - this is where the main application will live. Does this follow the service layer methodology? 
3. tests (folder) - holds all of the test scripts for checking the application. 
4. shooterlog.py - main entry into the program.


## Notes

Building with testing in mind initially, I'm starting with the athlete part of the project. I'll then look a the Goals and Drills pieces. Using Barky app and other code from the class as a baseline for how to make my *Shooters Log* work and build it up on the TDD
